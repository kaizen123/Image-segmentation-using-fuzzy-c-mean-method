# Image-segmentation-using-fuzzy-c-mean-method
Hello, Everyone
This is a project which i have started in college, which is image segmentation.

# Prerequisites
1. You should be familier with the basic concepts about Image and Image segmentation.
2. A basic knowledge of Digital Signal Processing should be helpful.
3. Familiarity with Matlab commands like Imread, Imhist etc. 
4. Knowlege of OOPS
5. knowlege of Mathematics, fourier series, fourier transform etc.  
6. Knowledge about fuzzy-logic and fuzzy partition functions. 

The Segmentation uses fuzzy-logic algorithm to segment image.

Thanks.
